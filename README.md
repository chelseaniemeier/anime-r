### Anime Recommendation/Rater App



#### Project title: 
Anime Recommendations

#### Motivation: 
The purpose of my project was to create an app/webpage where I can list & recommend my favorite anime shows. I can add an anime that I have watched and then leave a description of the show, along with a rating.

#### Build status: 
I've built the basics for the purpose of this project, but plan to build out some of the features of this project to a larger scale. Eventually I'd like to have a search bar/sorting function, a comments section, and user accounts.

#### Technology used: 
I used html, css, javascript, jquery, mLab, mongoose, express, handlebars.

#### Features: 
Your basic CRUD app that can Create, Read, Update & Delete.

#### The app is on a live link, hosted on Heroku: 
(https://anime-r.herokuapp.com/)

But if you want to run it locally, here is the following:

#### Installation for Code Louisville mentors/Brian:  
1. Download this repository. 
2. In your terminal, navigate to the root folder of this project. 
3. Run `npm install` to install necessary packages.
4. Type `npm start` in the terminal, it will begin setting up the local server. Wait till it says ```Anime Recommendations is listening on port 8080``` in the terminal.
5. Open up (http://localhost:8080/) in your browser. You will see there is no data showing (*yet!*). This is because I used **dotenv** to password protect the mLab database login/password. I will e-mail Brian, or to whom it may concern, the `.env` file that holds the login/password information. The `.env` needs to be in the root directory. This will allow the Code Louisville viewer to see the project data in the browser on (http://localhost:8080/) for the purpose of this project.
6. Refresh (http://localhost:8080/) in your browser. The database should be showing up now.
7. Have fun and recommend a show you like to watch!
