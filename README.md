Anime Rater App
Project title: Anime Recommendations

Motivation: The purpose of my project was to create an app/webpage where people can go visit the page and recommend their favorite/least favoriate anime shows. They can add an anime that they like (or dislike) and then leave a description of the show, along with a rating.

Build status: I've built the basics for the purpose of this project, but plan to build out some of the features of this project to a larger scale site that is live to the public.

Technology used: I used html, css, javascript/jquery, mLab, mongoose, express, handlebars.

Features: Your basic CRUD app that can Create, Read, Update & Delete.

Installation for Code Louisville mentors/leaders who are grading this: First you need to download the repository. Open up http://localhost:3030/ in your browser. Open up your terminal and navigate to the root folder of this project. If you type "npm start" in the terminal, then refresh the browser, you will see there is no data showing. This is because I used dotenv to password protect the mLab database login/password. I will e-mail Brian, or to whom it may concern, the .env file that holds the password information. The .env needs to be in the root directory. This will allow the Code Louisville viewer to see my data on localhost:3030 for the purpose of this project.
